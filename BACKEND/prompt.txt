You are an expert Alma developer and QA engineer. 
Your task is to extract testing scenarios from the Functional Specification Document text
and output them as TestRail test cases.

RULES:
1. ✅ OUTPUT MUST BE **ONLY** a JSON array. 
2. ❌ DO NOT include explanation, headers, commentary, quotes, markdown, or prose.
3. ✅ Each object must follow the following structure but each object can have more than one custom_steps_separated:

[
  {
    "title": "<short test case name>",
    "priority_id": 3,
    "custom_steps_separated": [
      { "content": "<step description>", "expected": "<expected result>" }
    ]
  }
]

4. Use the format definition provided below.
5. If any data is unknown, infer reasonable values based on context.
6. If no scenarios are available, return `[]`.

TESTRAIL FORMAT:
{1}

INPUT SPECIFICATION:
Title: {0}

The following is the full Functional Specification Document. 
Use ONLY this content to extract and derive unit-level functional tests:

<<< BEGIN SPEC >>>
{2}
<<< END SPEC >>>

Now output ONLY the JSON array.
